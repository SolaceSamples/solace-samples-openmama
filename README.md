# Solace Samples Template

This project is the common template from which all Solace Samples are merged. When creating a new Solace sample, you should fork this repo and then create your sample. Template updates can be applied by merging from this repo on both the `master` and `gh-pages` branch. The `gh-pages` branch is setup and ready to be used to create tutorials. See the [README](https://github.com/SolaceSamples/solace-samples-template/blob/gh-pages/README.md) in that branch for details. Any code and description in the samples should not overlap with this template.

## Instructions (to be deleted in a Solace Samples project)

Here are some instructions once you've forked the repository and are creating new Solace samples.

1. Update the repository links in [](CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Add your Samples source code to the master branch
3. Update this README with instructions on how to build and run.
4. Create walk through tutorials on the gh-pages branch. Again see [README](https://github.com/SolaceSamples/solace-samples-template/blob/gh-pages/README.md) on that branch for details.

Below this are common sections that should appear in all Solace Samples README.md. Leave them! :)

## Using Eclipse

To generate Eclipse metadata (.classpath and .project files), do the following:

    ./gradlew eclipse

Once complete, you may then import the projects into Eclipse as usual:

 *File -> Import -> Existing projects into workspace*

Browse to the *'solace-samples-java'* root directory. All projects should import
free of errors.

## Using IntelliJ IDEA

To generate IDEA metadata (.iml and .ipr files), do the following:

    ./gradlew idea
