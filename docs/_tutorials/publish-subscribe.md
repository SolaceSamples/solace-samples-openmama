## Assumptions

This tutorial assumes the following:

*   You are familiar with OpenMAMA [core concepts]({{ site.docs-openmama-concepts }}){:target="_top"}.
    *   If not, see [this OpenMAMA guide](http://www.openmama.org/content/quick-start-guide){:target="_blank"} and [Solace OpenMAMA “Hello World” tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/hello-world).
*   You are familiar with Solace [core concepts]({{ site.docs-solace-concepts }}){:target="_top"}.
*   You have access to a properly installed OpenMAMA [release](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/releases){:target="_blank"}.
    *   Solace middleware bridge with its dependencies is also installed
*   You have access to a running Solace Message Router with the following configuration:
    *   Enabled Message VPN
    *   Enabled Client Username

## Goals

The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate basic messaging interactions using OpenMAMA with the **Solace middleware bridge**. This tutorial’s samples are similar to the OpenMAMA’s [mamapublisherc.c](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/blob/master/mama/c_cpp/src/examples/c/mamapublisherc.c){:target="_blank"} and [mamasubscriberc.c](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/blob/master/mama/c_cpp/src/examples/c/mamasubscriberc.c){:target="_blank"}, but with a distinct focus on configuring OpenMAMA with **Solace Message Routers**. See the [Resources](#resources) section below for some further links to other OpenMAMA tutorials and examples.

This tutorial will show you how to publish a message with one string field to a specific topic on a Solace Message Router using OpenMAMA C API.

This tutorial will show you how to use OpenMAMA C API:

*   to build and send a message on a topic
*   to subscribe to a topic and receive a message

## Installation

Installation instructions for OpenMAMA can be found on [OpenMAMA Wiki](http://www.openmama.org/content/quick-start-guide#main){:target="_blank"}.

Simplified installation instructions for OpenMAMA with Solace middleware bridge [are available]({{ site.baseurl }}/installation-linux).

For building OpenMAMA from source see [OpenMAMA Wiki](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/wiki/Build-Instructions){:target="_blank"}.

## Getting Access to Solace Message Router

There are two ways you can get hold of the **Solace message router**:

*   If your company has Solace message routers deployed, contact your middleware team to obtain the host name or IP address of a Solace message router to test against, a username and password to access it, and a VPN in which you can produce and consume messages.
*   If you do not have access to a Solace message router, you will need to use the [Solace Virtual Message Router]({{ site.link-tech-vmr }}){:target="_top"}. Go through the [Set up a VMR]({{ site.docs-vmr-setup }}){:target="_top"} tutorial to download and install it. By default the Solace VMR will run with the `“default”` message VPN configured and ready for messaging.

Going forward, this tutorial assumes that you are using the Solace VMR. If you are using a different Solace message router configuration, adapt the instructions to match your configuration.

## Solace Message Router Properties

In order to send or receive messages to a Solace Message Router, you need to know a few details of how to connect to the Solace Message Router. Specifically you need to know the following:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Resource</th>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Host</td>
<td>String of the form `DNS name` or `IP:Port`</td>
<td>This is the address clients use when connecting to the Solace Message Router to send and receive messages. For a Solace VMR this there is only a single interface so the IP is the same as the management IP address. For Solace Message Router appliances this is the host address of the message-backbone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Message VPN</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>The Solace Message Router Message VPN that this client should connect to. The simplest option is to use the `default` message-vpn which is present on all Solace Message Routers and fully enabled for message traffic on Solace VMRs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Client Username</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>The client username. For the Solace VMR default message VPN, authentication is disabled by default, so this can be any value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Client Password</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>The optional client password. For the Solace VMR default message VPN, authentication is disabled by default, so this can be any value or omitted.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Example of specifying these properties [see here]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/src/pubsub/mama.properties){:target="_blank"} and detailed explanation of them is in the [Solace OpenMAMA “Hello World” tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/hello-world).

## Receiving Message

Before everything else, as you already know from the [Solace OpenMAMA “Hello World” tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/hello-world), we need to [initialize]({{ site.baseurl }}/hello-world/#initialize) the **Solace middleware bridge** and [create a transport]({{ site.baseurl }}/hello-world/#create-transport).

To learn more about how to initialize and configure **Solace middleware bridge as an OpenMAMA transport** see [Solace OpenMAMA User Guide]({{ site.docs-openmama-bridges }}){:target="_top"}

Now we can implement receiving a message.

First, let’s express interest in messages by subscribing to a topic. Then you can look at publishing a matching message and see it received.

In OpenMAMA subscribing to a topic means _creating a subscription_. When creating a subscription, we need to refer to a _transport_, a _receiver_ and to an _event queue_.

You already know what the **transport** is.

For details of the **event queue** see [OpenMAMA Developer’s Guide for C](http://www.openmama.org/sites/default/files/OpenMAMA%20Developer%27s%20Guide%20C.pdf){:target="_blank"}

When multi-threading is not required it is recommended to use the _default internal event queue_ as an _event queue_:

```cpp
mamaQueue defaultQueue;
mama_getDefaultEventQueue(global.bridge, &defaultQueue))
```

The **receiver** is a data structure with function pointers that are invoked by OpenMAMA when certain events happen.

It has a type of `mamaMsgCallbacks` and it is expected to have, as a minimum, the following function pointers:

*   `onCreate` that is invoked when a subscription is created
*   `onError` that is invoked when an error occurs
*   `onMsg` that is invoked when a message arrives on the subscribed topic

This is how the routine for creating a subscription is implemented:

```cpp
void subscribeToTopic(const char * topicName)
{
    global.subscription = NULL;
    mama_status status;
    if ((status = mamaSubscription_allocate(&global.subscription)) == MAMA_STATUS_OK)
    {
        // initialize functions called by MAMA on different subscription events
        memset(&global.receiver, 0, sizeof(global.receiver));
        global.receiver.onCreate = onCreate;
        global.receiver.onError = onError;
        global.receiver.onMsg = onMessage;

        mamaQueue defaultQueue;
        if (((status = mama_getDefaultEventQueue(global.bridge, &defaultQueue)) == MAMA_STATUS_OK) &&
            ((status = mamaSubscription_createBasic(global.subscription, global.transport,
                                                    defaultQueue,
                                                    &global.receiver,
                                                    topicName,
                                                    NULL)) == MAMA_STATUS_OK))
        {
            // normal exit
            return;
        }
    }
    // error exit
    printf("Error subscribing to topic %s, error code: %s\n", topicName,
            mamaStatus_stringForStatus(status));
    mama_close();
    exit(status);
}
```

Notice that `global.receiver` is assigned with pointers to functions we want to be invoked by OpenMAMA when corresponding events happen.

When a subscription is created, we want to see its topic name on the console:

```cpp
void onCreate(mamaSubscription subscription, void * closure)
{
    const char * topicName = NULL;
    if (mamaSubscription_getSymbol(subscription, &topicName) == MAMA_STATUS_OK)
    {
        printf("Created subscription to topic \"%s\"\n", topicName);
    }
}
```

When an error occurs, we want to see on the console the error code:

```cpp
void onError(mamaSubscription subscription, mama_status status,
        void * platformError, const char * subject, void * closure)
{
    const char * topicName = NULL;
    if (mamaSubscription_getSymbol(subscription, &topicName) == MAMA_STATUS_OK)
    printf("Error occured with subscription to topic \"%s\", error code: %s\n",
            topicName, mamaStatus_stringForStatus(status));
}
```

When a message arrives, we extract from the message the topic name and a custom string field we know was added to that message:

```cpp
void onMessage(mamaSubscription subscription, mamaMsg message, void * closure, void * itemClosure)
{
    const char * topicName = NULL;
    if (mamaSubscription_getSymbol(subscription, &topicName) == MAMA_STATUS_OK)
    {
        printf("Message of type %s received on topic \"%s\"\n", mamaMsgType_stringForMsg(message), topicName);
    }
    // extract from the message our own custom field
    const char * const MY_FIELD_NAME = "MdMyTimestamp";
    const int MY_FIELD_ID = 99, BUFFER_SIZE = 32;
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    if (mamaMsg_getFieldAsString(message, MY_FIELD_NAME, MY_FIELD_ID, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE)
            == MAMA_STATUS_OK)
    {
        printf("This message has a field \"%s\" with value: %s", MY_FIELD_NAME, buffer);
    }
}
```

Now we can start receiving messages:

```cpp
mama_start(global.bridge);
```

This `mama_start` call blocks execution of the current thread until `mama_stop` is called, that is why we need to implement a handler for stopping our program by pressing `Ctrl-C` from console.

```cpp
void stopHandler(int value)
{
    signal(value, SIG_IGN);
    printf(" Do you want to stop the program? [y/n]: ");
    char answer = getchar();
    if (answer == 'y')
        stopAll();
    else
        signal(SIGINT, stopHandler);
    getchar();
}
```

The `stopAll` routine has `destroy` calls for the created transport and subscription.

Order of calls in that routine is very important and the very first one must be `mama_stop`:

```cpp
void stopAll()
{
    mama_stop(global.bridge);
    if (global.subscription)
    {
        mamaSubscription_destroy(global.subscription);
        global.subscription = NULL;
    }
    if (global.transport)
    {
        mamaTransport_destroy(global.transport);
        global.transport = NULL;
    }
}
```

## Sending Message

As usual, before everything else, we need to [initialize]({{ site.baseurl }}/hello-world/#initialize) the **Solace middleware bridge** and [create a transport]({{ site.baseurl }}/hello-world/#create-transport).

Now we can implement sending a message, and as you already know from the [Solace OpenMAMA “Hello World” tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/hello-world/#create-publisher), to publish a message we need to create a _publisher_.

A _publisher_ is created for a specific topic and refers to already created _transport_:

```c
global.publisher = NULL;
mamaPublisher_create(&global.publisher, global.transport, publishTopicName, NULL, NULL)
```

We want our program to publish messages periodically, until we stop it (by pressing `Ctrl-C` from console).

OpenMAMA provides a very convenient mechanism for a periodic event in a forms of _mamaTimer_. Such timers created with a reference to an _event queue_ and we can use the _default internal event queue_ for it:

```cpp
global.publishTimer = NULL;
mamaTimer_create(&global.publishTimer, defaultQueue, timerCallback, intervalSeconds, NULL);
```

The `timerCallback` parameter is a pointer to a function that will be invoked by OpenMAMA when the timer expires.

We’re going to implement this function to send one message with three different fields, one of them is a custom field with the message timestamp as a string:

```cpp
void timerCallback(mamaTimer timer, void* closure)
{
    // generate a timestamp as one of the message fields
    char buffer[32];
    time_t currTime = time(NULL);
    sprintf(buffer, "%s", asctime(localtime(&currTime)));
    // create message and add three fields to it
    mamaMsg message = NULL;
    mama_status status;
    if (((status = mamaMsg_create(&message)) == MAMA_STATUS_OK) &&
        ((status = mamaMsg_addI32(message, MamaFieldMsgType.mName, MamaFieldMsgType.mFid,
                                  MAMA_MSG_TYPE_INITIAL)) == MAMA_STATUS_OK) &&
        ((status = mamaMsg_addI32(message, MamaFieldMsgStatus.mName, MamaFieldMsgStatus.mFid,
                                  MAMA_MSG_STATUS_OK)) == MAMA_STATUS_OK) &&
        ((status = mamaMsg_addString(message, "MdMyTimestamp", 99,
                                     buffer)) == MAMA_STATUS_OK))
    {
        if ((status = mamaPublisher_send(global.publisher, message)) == MAMA_STATUS_OK)
        {
            printf("Message published: %s", buffer);
            mamaMsg_destroy(message);
            // normal exit
            return;
        }
    }
    // error exit
    printf("Error publishing message: %s\n", mamaStatus_stringForStatus(status));
}
```

Now we can start sending messages:

```cpp
mama_start(global.bridge);
```

Because `mama_start` call blocks execution of the current thread until `mama_stop` is called, we’re going to use the handler mechanism for stopping our program by pressing `Ctrl-C` from console.

That handler calls `stopAll`. As you already know, order of calls in `stopAll` routine is very important and the very first one must be `mama_stop`:

```cpp
void stopAll()
{
    mama_stop(global.bridge);
    // order is important
    if (global.publishTimer)
    {
        mamaTimer_destroy(global.publishTimer);
        global.publishTimer = NULL;
    }
    if (global.publisher)
    {
        mamaPublisher_destroy(global.publisher);
        global.publisher = NULL;
    }
    if (global.transport)
    {
        mamaTransport_destroy(global.transport);
        global.transport = NULL;
    }
}
```

## Summarizing

Our application consists of two executables: _topicSubscriber_ and _topicPublisher_.

If you combine the example source code shown above and split them into the two mentioned executables, it results in the source that is available for download:

*   [mama.properties]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/src/pubsub/mama.properties){:target="_blank"}
*   [topicSubscriber.c]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/src/pubsub/topicSubscriber.c){:target="_blank"}
*   [topicPublisher.c]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/src/pubsub/topicPublisher.c){:target="_blank"}

### Building

To build on **Linux**, assuming OpenMAMA installed into `/opt/openmama`:

```
$ gcc -o topicSubscriber topicSubscriber.c -I/opt/openmama/include -L/opt/openmama/lib -lmama
$ gcc -o topicPublisher topicPublisher.c -I/opt/openmama/include -L/opt/openmama/lib -lmama
```

### Running the Application

First, start the _topicSubscriber_:

```
$ ./topicSubscriber

```

Now in a separate console start the _topicPublisher_ that begins publishing messages periodically:

```
$ ./topicPublisher
