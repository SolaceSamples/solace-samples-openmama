Download pre-packaged OpenMAMA from the [OpenMAMA GitHub releases page](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/releases){:target="_blank"}:

    $ wget https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/releases/download/OpenMAMA-6.2.0-release/openmama-6.2.0-1.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm


Install it with `rpm`:

    $ sudo rpm --install openmama-6.2.0-1.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm


Files will be installed into `/opt/openmama` directory:

    $ ls /opt/openmama
    bin config COPYING data examples includes lib

Configuring of the installation means editing and referring the `mama.properties` configuration file at `/opt/openamama/config`.

If you would try to run any of the files in the OpenMAMA `bin` directory, you will get error `“cannot open shared object file”`. This is because all OpenMAMA shared libraries are located in `/opt/openmama/lib` and need to be referred to explicitly.

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/openmama/lib
    $ /opt/openmama/bin/mamasubscriberc –help
    This sample application demonstrates how to subscribe and process mamaMsg’s from a basic subscription.

The most important configuration parameter of OpenMAMA is the middleware bridge.

Bridge is what communicates with a specific messaging broker, and different bridges implementation details are hidden by OpenMAMA interfaces and entities. This is what makes OpenMAMA so powerful: applications are written without being coupled to specific messaging brokers.

Out-of-box `mama.properties` refers to the **Apache Qpid** middleware bridge, and most of the OpenMAMA sample applications by default refer to a different (proprietary) bridge, but we’re going to use the **Solace middleware bridge** that enables communication with a **Solace message router**.

The Solace middleware bridge is currently unavailable for public download. For access, please contact [Solace Customer Support]({{ site.link-support }}){:target="_top"}.

    $ wget <…location...>/solopenmama_bridge_Linux26-x86_64_opt_7.3.0.7.tar.gz

Untar it into a dedicated location and append this location **lib** directory to **LD_LIBRARY_PATH**.

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<…>/solopenmama_bridge/lib

The Solace middleware bridge implementation has a dependency on **Solace Messaging API for C**. The C API library can be [downloaded here]({{ site.link-downloads }}){:target="_top"}.

    $ wget <…location…>/solclient_Linux26-x86_64_opt_7.3.0.7.tar.gz

Untar it into a dedicated location and append this location **lib** directory to **LD_LIBRARY_PATH**.

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<…>/solclient/lib

Use `ldd` to verify dependences:

```
$ ldd topicPublishOne
    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffcf53d4000)
    libmama.so => not found
    libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f38bc75d000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f38bcb3a000)

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/openmama/lib
$ ldd topicPublishOne
    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffe429fd000)

    libdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f9ed2a82000)
    libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f9ed2866000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f9ed3810000)
